# Dynamic Random Image Gallery

This is a simple Dynamic Random Image Gallery built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

When the user clicks the button, new random images are added to the page instantly without refreshing the browser.

## Features

* Add random images with one click
* Dynamic image generation
* No page reload required
* Clean and simple layout

## What I Learned

While building this project, I practiced:

* DOM manipulation
* Creating elements using JavaScript
* Using loops
* Working with Math.random()
* Appending elements dynamically

This project helped me understand how websites can load and display content dynamically instead of writing everything manually in HTML.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## How It Works

* The button listens for a click event
* When clicked, JavaScript runs a loop
* Inside the loop, new image elements are created
* Each image gets a random source URL
* The images are appended to the container

## How to Use

1. Open the project in your browser
2. Click the button
3. New random images will appear instantly
4. Click again to add more images
